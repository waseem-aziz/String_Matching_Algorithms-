# String_Matching_Algorithms-
This Python application offers implementations of three string matching algorithms: Rabin-Karp, Naive, and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP). Efficiently find occurrences of a pattern within a given text using these algorithms.

Usage
Run string_matching.py, input the pattern and text, then choose the algorithm(s). The output will display the indices where the pattern is found in the text.
